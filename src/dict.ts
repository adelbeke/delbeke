Additionally, users had the ability to create NFTs from images or videos. While the app was predominantly active on Android, boasting around 1000 users, its expansion to iOS was stalled due to Apple\'s refusal to approve its blockchain-based purchase process, which prevented Apple from taking a percentage of the transactions. Furthermore, Ko made a significant milestone by conducting the world\'s first live NFT video presentation at the CES in Las Vegas in 2023, showcasing an innovative step forward for the application.'

These establishments could freely set their available hours, pricing, and other parameters. However, due to the pandemic, the initiative pivoted to the creation of virtual rooms represented on a map, allowing users to invite others to join. Each room could be customized with a specific theme and name, making the product especially appealing for virtual gatherings, such as having a drink with family.'
